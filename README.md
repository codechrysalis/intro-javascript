## Advice and Tips

* Don't be afraid to reach out to other professionals or to the community at large. Someone is always willing to teach!
* Don't be afraid to ask for help or help people back.
* Practice, practice, practice. Just reading won't do anything.
* Stick with one language--learning multiple languages in the beginning can be confusing.
* Google is your best friend.
* Be careful with copy and pasting code---always make sure you understand it. Don't study the solution.
* Read/learn to read the documentation. It's hard and frustrating, just like learning any other new skill.
* Failing a lot is completely normal. Coding is an unending parade of error messages--as long as you're getting a new error, you're making progress.
* Stay small---focus on the next possible thing to do.
