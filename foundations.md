## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

You will only need your Chrome browser with the developer console open for the following activities.

#### Vocabulary

Can you try to define the following in your own words?

- _expression_
- _operator_
- _type_

#### `number`s & `string`s

##### `number`s

1.  Enter the below expressions, line by line, into your Chrome console. What happens for each?

    ```js
    4 + 10;
    1 * 3;
    12 * 4;
    4 % 2;
    5 % 2;
    5 / 1 - 99;
    5000 * -100 * (1 + 2) * (5 * 6);
    1241 / 9 + 99;
    ```

1.  Based on your work above, what does `%` do?

1.  Calculate your age in minutes using the console.

##### Bonus Section

1.  The console is getting a little full. Use `clear()` to clean things up a little.

##### `string`s

1.  In your console, put your name in a `string`!

1.  Use the `+` operator to _concatenate_ (join together) two or more
    `string`s, _e.g._:

    ```js
    // Your first and last names as an example
    "Yan " + "Fan";
    ```

    - Your first and last names (as shown above in the example code snippet)
    - Your favourite singer's full name
    - Code Chrysalis

1.  Try the following in your console, line by line. What happens? Fix the errors:

    ```js
    Where are the quotes?
    'hmm something is not right"
    'Do other ' * 'operators work with string concatenation?
    ```

1.  We want you to get comfortable with actively exploring through code. Answer the following questions by coding to test the questions:
    1.  What happens when I add a `string` and a `number` together?
    1.  What if I reverse the order (e.g. `number` + `string`)?
    1.  What happens if I multiply a `number` 5 with a `string` "5"?
